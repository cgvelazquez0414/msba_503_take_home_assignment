# Project Description:
I utilized two deep learning image detection algorithms, YOLO (You Only Look Once) and R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network), along with one non-deep learning algorithm, ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF), to detect objects and keypoints in images. YOLOâ€™s main advantage lies in its speed and ability to perform real-time object detection, but it has limitations in handling small objects or overlapping detections in complex scenes. R-CNN, on the other hand, produced more accurate results due to its ability to focus on regions of interest and perform finer-grained detections, though it requires significantly more computational resources and time for processing.

The non-deep learning algorithm, ORB, is effective at finding keypoints and descriptors, which can be used for tasks like object recognition or image matching. Additionally, ORB provides valuable metadata, including location, scale, and orientation, to help analyze image features. To synthesize the findings, I summarized and compared the performance of the YOLO and R-CNN models through visualizations, offering clearer insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and overall effectiveness.
